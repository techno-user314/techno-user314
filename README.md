## Hi there 👋

I’m **techno_user314**, a developer with over 10 years of amatuer programming experience. 
  
I enjoy working on coding projects that require logical thinking to create practical algorithmic implementation, and I particularly enjoy it when math, logic, and code collide in one project.  
I also have a growing interest in data science.😉  
  
My primary language is Python, though I’m also building my skills in C-based languages.
