## Hi there 👋

I’m **techno_user314**, a developer with over 10 years of hobbyist programming experience. 
  
I have build programs for both personal and organizational use, and I enjoy working on coding projects that require logical thinking to create practical algorithmic implementation. I particularly enjoy it when math, logic, and code collide in one project, so I natuarally also have a growing interest in data science.😉  
  
My primary language is Python, though I’m also building my skills in C-based languages.
