## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **techno_user314**, a developer with over 10 years of programming experience. 
  
I enjoy tackling coding projects that blend analytical thinking with practical algorithmic implementation, and I particularly enjoy exploring the intersection of math, logic, and code. Unsurprisingly, I also have an interest in data science.  
  
My primary language is Python, though Iâ€™m also building expertise in C-based languages.
